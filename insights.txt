Telco Customer Churn Analysis Report
1. Project Introduction
This project aims to analyze telecommunication customer data to understand the key factors leading to customer churn (attrition). Additionally, it seeks to build a machine learning model to predict customers at risk of churning. Customer churn poses a significant challenge for telecom companies, and comprehending its root causes can aid in developing effective customer retention strategies and reducing associated costs.

2. Data Used
The Telco Customer Churn dataset was utilized for this project. It contains 7043 customer records and 21 columns of information, including:

Demographic Information: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner (presence of a partner), Dependents (presence of dependents).
Customer Services: PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies.
Account Information: Tenure (duration of subscription), Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.
Target Variable: Churn (customer churn: Yes/No).
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:
11 missing values were identified in the TotalCharges column. Given that this represents a small percentage of the data (approximately 0.15%), the affected rows were dropped. (Alternatively, these could have been imputed with the mean/median based on analysis choice).
Data Type Conversion:
The TotalCharges column was of object (text) type due to the presence of blank spaces. These blanks were converted to missing values (NaN), and then the column was converted to a numeric (float) type.
The customerID column was dropped as it serves as a unique identifier and does not contribute to the analysis or modeling.
Categorical Encoding:
The target column Churn and the gender column were converted to numerical values (0 and 1).
One-Hot Encoding was applied to other categorical columns with more than two options (e.g., InternetService, Contract, PaymentMethod) to transform them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A. Churn Distribution:

The proportion of customers who churned was approximately X% (state the actual percentage calculated in EDA). This indicates that the dataset is imbalanced.
B. Factors Influencing Churn:

Internet Services: Customers without "Online Security" or "Tech Support" exhibited a significantly higher churn rate. Customers subscribing to Fiber optic internet service also showed a higher churn rate compared to DSL.
Contract Type: Customers with "Month-to-month" contracts had a substantially higher churn rate compared to those with long-term contracts (one-year or two-year). This highlights the importance of loyalty programs and longer contracts.
Payment Method: Customers using "Electronic check" as a payment method displayed a higher churn rate.
Tenure: New customers (with short tenure) were more prone to churn. As tenure increased, the churn rate generally decreased.
Monthly Charges: Customers with higher monthly charges tended to churn more frequently.
Total Charges: Customers who paid lower total amounts were more likely to churn, reflecting a correlation with shorter tenure.
5. Machine Learning Modeling
A. Data Preparation for Modeling:

The dataset was split into features (X) and the target variable (y - Churn).
The data was further divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split with stratify=y to maintain the Churn class distribution in both sets.
StandardScaler was applied to numerical variables (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) to standardize their scale, a crucial step for the Logistic Regression algorithm.
B. Model Building:

A Logistic Regression model was used. This is a simple, effective linear classification model often employed as a baseline.
C. Model Evaluation:

Accuracy: [State Value] - The overall correctness of the model's predictions.

Precision (for Churn=1): [State Value] - Out of all predictions where the model said a customer would churn, how many were actually correct.

Recall (for Churn=1): [State Value] - Out of all customers who actually churned, how many were successfully identified by the model.

F1-Score (for Churn=1): [State Value] - A balanced measure of precision and recall.

ROC AUC Score: [State Value] - Reflects the model's ability to distinguish between churning and non-churning customers. A score closer to 1 indicates better discrimination.

Confusion Matrix: [Attach Image or Describe Results]

(Example: X correct predictions for "No Churn" (True Negatives), Y incorrect predictions for "No Churn" (False Positives), Z incorrect predictions for "Churn" (False Negatives), W correct predictions for "Churn" (True Positives)).
ROC Curve: [Attach Image] - Illustrates the trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate.

6. Insights and Recommendations
Based on the exploratory analysis and model performance, the following recommendations can be provided to the telecom company:

Loyalty Programs and Long-Term Contracts:
The company should focus on migrating customers from month-to-month contracts to one or two-year contracts by offering attractive incentives.
Launch loyalty programs for new customers to increase their initial retention period.
Improve Service Quality and Technical Support:
Prioritize improving "Online Security" and "Tech Support" services, as their absence is strongly correlated with churn.
Investigate the reasons behind the high churn rate among "Fiber Optic" customers (e.g., potential quality or support issues).
Review Billing and Payment Strategies:
Analyze the reasons for the high churn rate among "Electronic check" users and offer alternative solutions or educate customers about other payment methods.
Review pricing plans for customers with high monthly charges to identify opportunities for providing better value or targeted discounts.
New Customer Retention Programs:
Identify customers early in their tenure and offer personalized deals or additional support to prevent early churn.
7. Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of customer churn data, revealing key factors influencing customer decisions to stay or leave. The predictive model can assist the company in proactively identifying at-risk customers, enabling targeted retention interventions.
